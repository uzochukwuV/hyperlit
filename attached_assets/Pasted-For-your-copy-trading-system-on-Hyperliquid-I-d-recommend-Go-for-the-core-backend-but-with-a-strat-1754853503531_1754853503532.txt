For your copy trading system on Hyperliquid, I'd recommend Go for the core backend, but with a strategic hybrid approach. Here's my analysis:
Go Advantages for Copy Trading:
Performance & Concurrency

Goroutines: Perfect for monitoring multiple traders simultaneously
Channels: Excellent for real-time order pipeline management
Low Latency: Critical for sub-second trade copying
Memory Efficient: Handle thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections

Financial Systems

Precision: Built-in big.Float for accurate financial calculations
Reliability: Strong typing prevents costly trading errors
Concurrency Safety: Race condition protection crucial for trading

WebSocket & API Handling

gorilla/websocket: Robust WebSocket client
Built-in HTTP: Excellent REST API support
JSON Performance: Fast marshaling/unmarshaling for API responses

Python Advantages:
Rapid Development

Faster Prototyping: Get MVP running quickly for hackathon
Rich Ecosystem: pandas for data analysis, asyncio for async operations
Hyperliquid SDK: Official Python SDK already exists

Go Core System (Recommended Primary):
go// Example architecture
type CopyTradingEngine struct {
    wsManager    *WebSocketManager
    orderEngine  *OrderEngine
    riskManager  *RiskManager
    followers    map[string]*Follower
    leaders      map[string]*Leader
}

// Concurrent leader monitoring
func (c *CopyTradingEngine) MonitorLeader(leaderAddr string) {
    go func() {
        for trade := range c.wsManager.GetTradeStream(leaderAddr) {
            c.ProcessLeaderTrade(trade)
        }
    }()
}

// High-performance order execution
func (c *CopyTradingEngine) ExecuteFollowerTrades(trades []Trade) error {
    var wg sync.WaitGroup
    for _, trade := range trades {
        wg.Add(1)
        go func(t Trade) {
            defer wg.Done()
            c.orderEngine.ExecuteTrade(t)
        }(trade)
    }
    wg.Wait()
    return nil
}
Why Go Wins for Hackathon:
1. Performance Metrics

Latency: Go can achieve <100ms trade copying vs Python's ~500ms+
Throughput: Handle 10k+ concurrent followers vs Python's ~1k
Memory: 10x more memory efficient for WebSocket connections

2. Hackathon Advantages

Impressive Demos: Real-time performance showcases better
Scalability Story: Judges love seeing production-ready architecture
Technical Depth: Go demonstrates serious engineering skills
Reliability: Fewer crashes during live demos

3. Ecosystem Match

Blockchain Native: Go is the language of choice for blockchain infrastructure
Hyperliquid Alignment: Matches the performance-first mindset
Professional Grade: What production trading systems actually use

Strategic Implementation Plan:
Phase 1: Go MVP (Week 1-2)
go// Core components
- WebSocket connection manager
- Basic order copying logic  
- Simple risk management
- REST API for frontend
Phase 2: Python Analytics (Week 3)
python# Add sophisticated features
- Trader performance analysis
- ML-based risk scoring
- Advanced portfolio optimization
- Historical backtesting
Phase 3: Integration (Week 4)

Go calls Python microservices for analytics
React frontend consumes Go REST API
Polish and optimization

Bounty Strategy:

Go SDK: Fulfill the "Hyperliquid SDK in other languages" bounty ($3k)
Copy Trading: Main Frontier Track submission in Go
Transaction Simulator: Go-based high-performance simulator
Alchemy Integration: Go client with Python analytics

Final Recommendation: Start with Go
The performance advantages are too significant to ignore for a trading system. Python is great for analytics and ML, but Go's concurrency model and speed are perfect for the real-time nature of copy trading.
Quick Start: Use the existing Python SDK to understand the APIs, then build your production system in Go. This gives you the best of both worlds!
